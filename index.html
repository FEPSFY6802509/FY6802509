  The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is an infrared telescope which is studying the formation of the first galaxies, 
  while looking inside dust clouds where stars and planetary systems are forming today (NASA, 2014). With its improved sensitivity 
  and longer wavelength coverage it should improve the discoveries of the Hubble Space Telescope (NASA, 2014). The current model of
  cosmological development is in figure 1 (). There has been much scientific debate recently over some discoveries such as spiral arm 
  (formations in galaxies) and early galaxies being much larger than expected disproving our current models such as Milky Way sized 
  galaxies forming much earlier (Mann. A, 2023). The main debate which has led to numerous scientific experts to deny the fact that 
  there were enormous galaxies exceedingly early on in formation such as the properties show 
  many low mass, young stars which would decrease the size significantly (Mann. A, 2023).

  There has been a consensus on formations of galaxies and galaxy formations which we have believed to be true since 
  the launch of the HST (Hubble Space Telescope). However, recently the JWST has discovered that spiral arms formed hundreds of
  millions of years before the theorised point and massive galaxies also formed much closer to the Big Bang which has caused 
  significant debate within the scientific community. 
  <h3 id="JWST Proof for a Change in Cosmological Theories">JWST Proof for a Change in Cosmological Theories</h3> 
  The proof that the cosmological theories on development could be incorrect is that the JWST found significant areas which 
  have elevated levels of redshift withinthe early time on a galactic scale. () Described by Erica June Nelson as “big honking 
  red disks” (Mann. A, 2023) the elevated levels of redshift point towards the idea that there were extremely large galaxies in
  the early universe which were 10 billion to 100 billion times the mass of the sun (Mann. A, 2023). This would make it comparable
  in size to our current Milky Way (Mann. A, 2023). Even though our galaxy formed 500 million years after the Big Bang (), it did not
  become an adolescent galaxy until 1 to 2 billion years after the Big Bang (). It did not fully exit the adolescent stage until 8 
  billion years ago (). So, for the galaxy observed with that high of a redshift our current viewpoint is incorrect and Michael Boylan
  -Kolchin a theoretical astrophysicist of the University of Texas claimed, “Their quoted properties so massive that it’s really hard 
  to see how you can form those and keep our current models of cosmology intact,” (Mann. A, 2023). This proves thatthe current theories 
  must be incorrect and adjusted to provide the correct idea on cosmological development.

  Furthermore, images from the JWST as seen in figure show spiral arms and other formations formed much earlier than expected (). 
  A study using the JWST of 3956  galaxies () proved on average that galaxy arms, spirals and bars were forming much closer to 3.7 billion
  years after the Big Bang () rather than the first theorised point of 6 billion years after the Big Bang (). This idea was later backed by 
  Leonardo Ferreria of the University of Victoria as the “the JWST finds so many is another sign of this instrument's power and that the 
  structures of galaxies form earlier in the  Universe, much earlier in fact, than anyone anticipated.” This clearly shows that the current
  theories on cosmology are wrong and that the fact the JWST has proven to show these formations to appear 2.3 billion years prior to the 
  current viewpoint could prompt a rethink of the past 10 billion years of cosmological evolution.

  However, there have been many points of discussion among the scientific community on the two previously discussed points. The extremely large redshift values 
  could have been due to incorrect photometric calibration (). Further photometric calibration saw a meaningful change in the photometric zero points (). This means
  there was a large zero error which could have been the result of the elevated red shift values discovered. Additionally, both French and American teams both showed
  that the properties were far different than originally thought as well (). They proved that these galaxies were full of young, low mass stars () which would shrink 
  the galaxies by 1,000 times (). Adding to this the original scientist who presented the data claimed that it “required too many unlikely premises to be right” (). 
  This clearly shows that the original data that was proposed was wrong, the scientist which provided the evidence dismissing their own points and two other teams both 
  disproving the thought of size all makes the conclusion that the theories were in fact never wrong and perhaps were always correct. The data coming out of the JWST on
  spiral arms, spirals and bars shows a significant lack of a rebuttal from the scientific community. Due to the images captured () by the JWST it clearly proves that 
  these features were forming far earlier than expected by 2.3 billion years. This again shows that instead of a total rethink of cosmological developments, we must 
  only adjust some ideas over the past 10 billion years.

  Overall, there has been considerable evidence which has pointed to the possible idea of the JWST disproving our current viewpoint on galaxy formation. The JWST showed
  “big honking red disks” (Mann. A, 2023) which they originally thought was a galaxy 100 billion times the size of our sun (Mann. A, 2023). These galaxies would be reaching
  the adolescent stage much earlier than predicted however due to wrong photometric calibration, both a French and American team both proving that the properties showed of 
  a galaxy full of young, low mass stars decreasing the size by 1000 times() and the original scientists claimed that it “required too many unlikely premises to be right”(),
  it is safe to conclude that this part of the theories are not wrong. There also has been little to no disagreement on the fact that galaxy arms, spirals and bars formed 
  only 3.7 billion years after the Big Bang as it was once originally thought to form 6 billion years after the Big Bang due to the images from the JWST. This could show that the 
  JWST has proved that certain features of our universe formed earlier than we expected and could prove that only some of our ideas were disproven. The JWST has also prompted 
  a rethink of the past 10 billion years due to this discovery.
