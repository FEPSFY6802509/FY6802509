  The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is an infrared telescope which is studying the formation of the first galaxies, 
  while looking inside dust clouds where stars and planetary systems are forming today <a href="#NASA, 2014">(NASA, 2014)</a>. With its improved sensitivity 
  and longer wavelength coverage it should improve the discoveries of the Hubble Space Telescope <a href="#NASA, 2014">(NASA, 2014)</a>. The current model of
  cosmological development is in figure 1 <a href="#NASA, (2012)">(NASA, 2012)</a>. There has been much scientific debate recently over some discoveries such as 
  spiral arm (formations in galaxies) and early galaxies being much larger than expected disproving our current models such as 
  Milky Way sized galaxies forming much earlier <a href="#Mann. A">(Mann. A, 2023)</a>. The main debate which has led to numerous scientific experts
  to deny the fact that  there were enormous galaxies exceedingly early on in formation such as the properties  show many low mass, 
  young stars which would decrease the size significantly <a href="#Mann. A">(Mann. A, 2023)</a>.

<pre>
  There has been a consensus on the formation of galaxies and galaxy structures which we have believed to be true since 
  the launch of the HST (Hubble Space Telescope). However, recently the JWST has discovered that spiral arms formed hundreds of
  millions of years before the theorised point <a href="#Kuthunur. S, (2023)">(Kuthunur. S, 2023)</a> and massive galaxies also formed much closer to the Big Bang 
  which has caused significant debate within the scientific community <a href="#Mann. A">(Mann. A, 2023)</a>. 
  <h3 id="JWST Proof for a Change in Cosmological Theories">JWST Proof for a Change in Cosmological Theories</h3> 
  The proof that the cosmological theories on development could be incorrect is that the JWST found significant areas 
  which have elevated levels of redshift withinthe early time on a galactic scale. <a href="#Ferrara. A, Dayal. P">(Ferrara. A, Dayal. P, 2018)</a> Described 
  by Erica June Nelson as “big honking red disks” <a href="#Mann. A">(Mann. A, 2023)</a> the elevated levels of redshift point towards the idea that there were 
  extremely large galaxies in the early universe which were 10 billion to 100 billion times the mass of the sun <a href="#Mann. A">(Mann. A, 2023)</a>. This would 
  make it comparable in size to our current Milky Way <a href="#Mann. A">(Mann. A, 2023)</a>. The average galaxy do not become an adolescent galaxy until 1 to 2 
  billion years after the Big Bang <a href="#NASA 2021">(NASA, 2021) </a>. It did not fully exit the adolescent stage until 8 billion years ago <a href="#Rix. H">(Rix. H, Xiang. M, 2022)</a>.
  So, for the galaxy observed with that high of a redshift our current and to be that size so early in cosmological development the theoryis incorrect and Michael Boylan-Kolchin
  a theoretical astrophysicist of the University of Texas claimed, “Their quoted properties so massive that it’s really hard to see how you can form those and keep our current
  models of cosmologyintact,” <a href="#Mann. A">(Mann. A, 2023)</a>. This proves thatthe current theories must be incorrect and adjusted to provide the correct idea 
  on cosmological development.

  Figure 2: Image shows photo captured by L. Ferreria and C. Conselice <a href="#Kuthunur. S, (2023)">(Kuthunur. S, 2023)</a>
  
  Furthermore, images from the JWST as seen in figure 2 it shows spiral arms and other formations formed much earlier than 
  expected <a href="#Kuthunur. S, (2023)">(Kuthunur. S, 2023)</a> but image taken by L. Ferreira and C. Conselice). A study using the JWST of 3956  galaxies 
  <a href="#Kuthunur. S, (2023)">(Kuthunur. S, 2023)</a> proved on average that galaxy arms, spirals and bars were forming much closer to 3.7 billion years after 
  the Big Bang <a href="#Kuthunur. S, (2023)">(Kuthunur. S, 2023)</a> rather than the first theorised point of 6 billion years after the Big Bang <a href="#Kuthunur. S, (2023)">(Kuthunur. S, 2023)</a>. 
  This idea was later backed by Leonardo Ferreria of the University of Victoria as the “the JWST finds so many is another sign of 
  this instrument's power and that the structures of galaxies form earlier in the  Universe, much earlier in fact, than anyone anticipated.”
  <a href="#Kuthunur. S, (2023)">(Kuthunur. S, 2023)</a> This clearly shows that the current theories on cosmology are wrong and that the fact the JWST has proven to show 
  these formations to appear 2.3 billion years <a href="#Kuthunur. S, (2023)">(Kuthunur. S, 2023)</a> prior to the current viewpoint could prompt a rethink of the past 10 
  billion years of cosmological evolution <a href="#Kuthunur. S, (2023)">(Kuthunur. S, 2023)</a>.

  However, there have been many points of discussion among the scientific community on the two previously discussed points. The 
  extremely large redshift values could have been due to incorrect photometric calibration <a href="#Steven L Finkelstein">(Finkelstein. S, (2023)</a>. Further photometric calibration saw a meaningful
  change in the photometric zero points <a href="#Steven L Finkelstein">(Finkelstein. S, (2023)</a>. This means there was a large zero error which could have been the result of the elevated red shift 
  values discovered. Additionally, both French and American teams both showed that the properties were far different than originally thought as
  well <a href="#Mann. A">(Mann. A, 2023)</a>. They proved that these galaxies were full of young, low mass stars <a href="#Mann. A">(Mann. A, 2023)</a> which would shrink the galaxies by 1,000 times <a href="#Mann. A">(Mann. A, 2023)</a>. Adding to 
  this the original scientist who presented the data claimed that it “required too many unlikely premises to be right” <a href="#Mann. A">(Mann. A, 2023)</a>. This clearly shows 
  that the original data that was proposed was wrong, the scientist which provided the evidence dismissing their own points and two other teams 
  both disproving the thought of size all makes the conclusion that the theories were in fact never wrong and perhaps were always correct. The 
  data coming out of the JWST on spiral arms, spirals and bars shows a significant lack of a rebuttal from the scientific community. Due to the
  images captured <a href="#Kuthunur. S, (2023)">(Kuthunur. S, 2023)</a> by the JWST it clearly proves that these features were forming far earlier than expected by 2.3 billion years <a href="#Kuthunur. S, (2023)">(Kuthunur. S, 2023)</a>. This again 
  shows that instead of a total rethink of cosmological developments, we must only adjust some ideas over the past 10 billion years <a href="#Kuthunur. S, (2023)">(Kuthunur. S, 2023)</a>.

<h3 id="Conclusion">Conclusion</h3>   
<pre>
  Overall, there has been considerable evidence which has pointed to the possible idea of the JWST disproving our current viewpoint on 
  galaxy formation. The JWST showed “big honking red disks” <a href="#Mann. A">(Mann. A, 2023)</a> which they originally thought was a galaxy 100 billion times the size
  of our sun <a href="#Mann. A">(Mann. A, 2023)</a>. These galaxies would be reaching the adolescent stage much earlier than predicted however due to wrong photometric 
  calibration <a href="#Steven L Finkelstein">(Finkelstein. S, (2023)</a>, both a French and American team both proving that the properties showed of a galaxy full of young, low mass stars decreasing the size
  by 1000 times <a href="#Mann. A">(Mann. A, 2023)</a> and the original scientists claimed that it “required too many unlikely premises to be right” <a href="#Mann. A">(Mann. A, 2023)</a>, it is safe to conclude that this 
  part of the theories are not wrong. There also has been little to no disagreement on the fact that galaxy arms, spirals and bars formed only 3.7 
  billion years after the Big Bang <a href="#Kuthunur. S, (2023)">(Kuthunur. S, 2023)</a> as it was once originally thought to form 6 billion years after the Big Bang <a href="#Kuthunur. S, (2023)">(Kuthunur. S, 2023)</a> due to the images from the JWST. This
  could show that the JWST has proved that certain features of our universe formed earlier than we expected and could prove that only some of our 
  ideas were disproven. The JWST has also prompted a rethink of the past 10 billion years due to this discovery <a href="#Kuthunur. S, (2023)">(Kuthunur. S, 2023)</a>.
