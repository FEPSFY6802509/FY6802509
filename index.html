  The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is an infrared telescope which is being used to study both the
  early development of galaxies within the first 1 billion years of the Universe and to take a closer 
  look into dust clouds. It can detect these features much better than the Hubble Space Telescope, a 
  previously launched infrared telescope, by having a greater range of infrared wavelengths. The early 
  ideals of galaxy formation claim that galaxies first became adolescents between 1 to 2 billion years 
  post the Big Bang.This is approximately when the Milky Way was formed. However, initial measurements 
  of the photometry, which is the measure of the intensity of light, showed giant galaxies with one which 
  could be the size of our own Miley Way to form much closer to the Big Bang. These ideas could illuminate 
  the fact that galaxies formed way quicker than our current theories. Images from the JWST have also shown 
  features such as spiral arms, bars and rings much earlier than expected. However, there has been much pushback 
  on these ideas as the fact that there are too many variable, recalibration has also shifted massively and the 
  original scientist who debated the original idea dismissed the idea of much earlier galaxy formation.

  For many years since the release of the Hubble Space Telescope there was a general consensus that most of the 
  galaxies formed during the first 1 billion years of the universe and being adolescent between 1 to 2 billion years
  after the Big Bang.  However, the JWST has recently discovered the fact that the idea of galaxies spiral arms, bars
  and rings had a much earlier formation place and that there were galaxies the size of the milky way less than 200 
  million years into the cosmological evolution of the universe.

  <h3 id="JWST Proof for a Change in Cosmological Theories">JWST Proof for a Change in Cosmological Theories</h3> 
  
  The proof that our early cosmology ideas of galaxy formation could not be perfect is that the current earliest galaxy
  detected is the GN-z11 which formed 400 million years after the Big Bang however using the increased range of infrared
  wavelengths scientists have found “big honking red disks” claimed by Erica June Nelson. This has elevated levels of 
  redshift. This made Erica June Nelson to theories that these were extremely massive galaxies each weighing 10 billion times
  the mass of our own sun with one nearly reaching 100 billion times the mass of our own sun (this would be a comparable size
  to our current galaxy). Seeing that our similar galaxy was formed significantly later than these galaxies (roughly 300 million
  to 500 million years after at a minimum) could imply that our viewpoint on early galaxy formation is not entirely correct.
  This clearly states that due to the sudden discoveries of exceedingly early Furthermore, there is an idea that early galaxies
  were far more regular than our current viewpoint. This is due to images such as figure 1 which shows milky way like galaxies 
  in the early universe. Features such as spiral arms, bars and rings were thought to have only formed roughly 6 billion years
  after the Big Bang at least due to the idea that the universe was too volatile and unpredictable to form these delicate shapes.
  However, a recent study using the JWST which considered 3,956 galaxies shows that these shapes could have formed close to only
  3.7 billion years after the Big Bang. This could question our overall understanding about early galaxy formation. This idea has
  also been supported by Leonardo Ferreria of the University of Victoria claiming that “the JWST finds so many is another sign of 
  this instrument's power and that the structures of galaxies form earlier in the Universe, much earlier in fact, than anyone anticipated.”
  This again proves that there is a possibility that the JWST has disproven our original ideas on early galaxy formation due to the
  fact that large galaxies, with a similar size to the Milky Way could have formed rough 300 million to 500 million years before 
  originally expected and that galactic features such as spiral arms, bars and rings formed roughly 2.3 billion years earlier than 
  originally predicted.

  However, there is noteworthy evidence that the data from the JWST is being misrepresented by scientists who believe the Milky Way 
  sized galaxy forming roughly 500 million to 700 million years post the Big Bang. This is due to the idea that a United State team 
  along with a French team both pointed out that the evidence collated appeared to show different properties than what was originally 
  thought. What they discovered was that the size of the stars in the galaxies observed were young, low mass stars which could shrink 
  the size of this galaxy to roughly 1,000 times. This means that the galaxies observed by the JWST would appear to be the correct size
  or what was expected to be at the current time frame for our current models on early cosmological developments and the way galaxies formed 
  it the incredibly early stage of our universe.  The idea of the early evolution being wrong was even dismissed by the scientists who 
  originally formulated the idea from the data claiming “required too many unlikely premises to be right.” Furthermore, the points put 
  forward by scientists such as Erica June Nelson and Boylan-Kolchin were taken on very early photometric calibration, further calibration
  saw a momentous change in the photometric zero points. This means that photometry, the branch of science which studies the measurement of
  the intensity of light, could have been significantly far off with a large zero error. This means that the original idea that our theories
  on early galaxy formation were never disproven by the JWST. This is because the data originally shown by the JWST had the wrong photometric 
  calibration which led to the misunderstanding and misrepresentation that our viewpoint on early galaxies were wrong. The data showing that 
  spiral arms, bars, and rings occurring 2.3 billion years before what scientists expected is very substantial and has not produced any other
  push back from other scientific teams. This could shows that perhaps the idea that our very central viewpoints of early galaxy formation was
  originally correct and the acknowledgment of perhaps a bit being wrong was based on wrong evidence and even dismissed by the original scientists,
  although the idea that spiral arms, bars and rings occurring at an earlier point in galactic history could be correct and could make use remakes
  our theory on galaxy evolution over the past 10 billion years.

<h3 id="Conclusion">Conclusion</h3>   
<pre>
  Overall, there has been significant evidence which has pointed to the possible idea of the JWST disproving our current viewpoint on galaxy formation.
  The JWST showed “big honking red disks” which they originally thought was a galaxy 100 billion times the size of our sun at about 500 to 700 million 
  years after the Big Bang when these types of galaxies were originally thought to form from 1 to 2 billion. It further captured images of spiral arms 3.7
  billion years after the Big Bang when originally thought that it was roughly 6 billion years. However, there has been many points of disagreement due to the 
  early photometric calibration originally being wrong which led to a large zero error, furthermore some of the scientist who proposed the idea realised there 
  were too many unlikily premises to be correct. French and American teams further pointed out that the characteristics of this galaxy match one of young, low 
  mass stars instead which would decrease the size of the galaxy by 1000 times and this new idea of the galaxy would meet our current theories on cosmological 
  evolution. This points to the idea that the JWST did not disprove our idea on early galaxy formation however has raised points due to the photos of the spiral 
  arms being taken 2.3 billion years before expected might make us rethink our original theories. Collectively, our theories on very early galxy formation has not
  been disproven by the JWST however it has proven that some galatic features such as spiral rings and arms occured much earlier than predicted which could enforce
  a change in the theory of galaxy evolution of the past 10 billion years.
